# Scipy-Package  

Hey guys  
This is a tutorial guide for starters of scipy package.  
You can learn basic using of scipy.stats and scipy.linalg in this guidence.

SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python.  
It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.  
SciPy on Python makes a powerful programming language available for use in developing sophisticated programs and specialized applications.
